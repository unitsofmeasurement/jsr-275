# (i) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being implemented;
#
# (ii) is clearly and prominently marked with the word "UNTESTED" or "EARLY ACCESS" or "INCOMPATIBLE" or "UNSTABLE" or "BETA" in any list of available builds and in proximity to every link initiating its download, where the list or link is under Licensee's control; and
